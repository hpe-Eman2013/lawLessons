    <h1>Syllabus: Reclaiming Your Estate</h1>
    <h3>Instructor: Derek Dante</h3>
    <h3>Study Schedule: Mondays, 7-9PM EST </h3>
    <h3>Course Length: 6 months</h3>
    <h3>Course Overview: </h3> <p>Acquire understanding of the process of correcting your status and standing

        recordings and other documental resources to broaden your understanding of the subject matter. Once the course
        is completed, the student will understand what documents should be recorded to end the presumptions that 
        those administering your estate have fraudulently claimed. All information is provided by the hard-working 
        people at the Vocational Science Of Freedom (VSOF). Audios and documents are provided by VSOF.
